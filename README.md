# Help Queue



## Project Outline

This repository contains both the front and back-end code of a program that provides a technical support queue. This project is a training exercise for full stack development. Specifically, this exercise was used to improve my understanding of Java Spring API development and DevOps.

The application allows users to report technical issues they are experiencing and enables admins to update support tickets with solutions.
